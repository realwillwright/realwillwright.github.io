How do I go and update this to the correct value? Within Dataverse there are 2 tables called \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Value\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Definition\u0026rsquo; these store the value of each variable and the definition of the variable respectively. The following guides will explain how to build a canvas app and/or a Flow to update the values only.\nThe two guides documented below are:\n Update variables in Dataverse using a canvas app  Example App    Update variables in Dataverse using Power Automate  Example Flow     You can of course go into each table and update them manually.\nUsing a Canvas App The canvas app will only find and update variables in the environment the app is in. The three main controls used in the app are:\n Gallery Edit Form Button   Create a new app using the tablet format Add the two Dataverse tables called \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Value\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Definition\u0026rsquo; as datasources Add a gallery to the screen and set the datasource as \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Definition\u0026rsquo;  Set the following properties as below    1X:02Width:700 Change the layout of the gallery to \u0026lsquo;Title and subtitle\u0026rsquo; In the gallery select the title control and update the text to  1ThisItem.\u0026#39;Display Name\u0026#39;  Add an Edit Form and use \u0026lsquo;Environment Variable Value\u0026rsquo; as the datasource  Set the following properties as below    1X:7002Width:Parent.Width - Self.X3Item:LookUp(\u0026#39;Environment Variable Values\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Environment Variable Definition\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;Environment Variable Definition\u0026#39; = Gallery1.Selected.\u0026#39;Environment Variable Definition\u0026#39;) In the Form add the following controls in order  Created On Value (value is the part to be updated)   Finally add a button control Update the OnSelect function to  1SubmitForm(Form1) Your app should be similar to the image below\n       You can now test the app in preview mode. Selecting an item in the galley making sure the form gets populated. Update the value to the required value and finally press the button.\nUsing a Power Automate Flow This guide explains how to create a manually triggered instant cloud flow to update environment variables.
